Thanks, Dan. You answered my question and spoke to the tree protection piece that I was looking for. Thank you for being a good steward. Please allow this email to serve as your approval for the geocache at O’Shaughnessy!

Thanks and happy caching!

Hi Tina,

Thank you for the extremely fast response, wow! 

The small bison tube is attached to a small branch near the trunk of a medium tree (about 7 inch wide trunk).  I always attach my caches like this with a zip tie that has at least 2 fingers of extra space to allow for growth of the tree.  I'm a rec tree climber so anything I can do to protect the trees, I'll do.  I have a couple pictures if you'd like to see them.

Thank you again Tina!

Hi There-

Thank you for reaching out about possibly placing a geocache.  I have a question about what you plan to attach the bison tube to, that’s about eye level and 4ft off of the trail?

 

Thanks!
