EmberQuest Ideas

At sea bays, have a ruined castle on the map as the base, create a "new" castle image to use as a texture for an agent.  
Then the agent can be stationary and fire upon the player ship.  When the player destroyes the tower, the map will show
a ruined tower.

For a "cloud" level..  Add an "Eagle" as a transport to fly 

TODO:
Add GC code, parking coords to chest dialog.
